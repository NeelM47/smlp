\subsection{Marabou coarse refinement}

The marabou SMT-based tool is used to speed up queries by utilizing the reluplex algorithm. A python interface is supplied and the module is built from source to allow for customization. Whilst the source denotes an optional dependency on the 3rd party LP solver Gurobi for MILP solving, due to licensing constraints it is currently not used.

\subsubsection{Building}

Overall instructions can be found at https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou using the latest version. This is built from source using the following set of commands:

\begin{verbatim}
cd path/to/marabou/repo/folder
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Overall structure}

A \verb+MarabouSolver+ object acts as a wrapper around a Marabou network, translating from the Z3 format. In general this is done through \verb+add+ similarily to a Z3 solver. The few exceptions to this require the use of specialized functions \verb+add_safepoint+ and \verb+add_counterexample+ which are necessary when dealing with constraints to output variables.

After applying constraints to the network, the constraints and the internal representation of the Z3 query (sexpr format) are outputted to a log file to be compared. The satisfiability of the input query is then determined using Marabou snc mode enabled, this is not entirely necessary however it marginally speeds up query speeds. The output is returned along with a model, is it exists, after which bounds are added on the input variables to the Z3 solver if the output is satisfiable. Bounds are used rather than absolute values to account for the accumulation of rounding errors, as Marabou uses floating point format, and to account for integer values. The size of the bounds currently is an arbitrary value however this can be changed. Finally, Z3 checks the validity of the Marabou bounds and ultimately outputs whether the model is truly satisfiable or not, preserving the original functionality of the Z3 implementation. 
For both finding a candidate and finding counter examples constraints on the output of the network are supplied and the solver is run.

\subsubsection{MarabouSolver structure}

The MarabouSolver class is where most of the computation occurs. It is a wrapper class aiming to emulate a Z3 solver with a few caveuts such as input format and type. The main functions used are "add" and "solve" as well as specialized initialization functions and reporting tools. The internal data structures used act as intermediary buffers for storing unprocessed constraints not yet applied to the network. 

\subsubsection{Current progress}

Marabou and Z3 seem to have the same internal constraints applied and most of, if not all bugs, have been eliminated. The last milestone is implementing a stack like system for preserving candidates between safepoint and counterexample - this issue was solved before however due to the solution of some bugs, a reimplementation must be made. To do this a reimplementation of the TFNetwork used throughout the class must be reimplemented using InputQuery objects placed in a stack or other such data structure - Not too difficult.
